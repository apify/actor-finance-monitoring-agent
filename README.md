## ðŸš€ How it works

2. **Processing**: The agent fetches real-time data, processes it using the selected AI model, and compiles a report.
3. **Output**: Generates a markdown report with analysis, which is pushed to Apify's dataset for review.

### Input Example

NOTE: The requirement to provide an OpenAI API key will be removed in the future by using Pay Per Event Actor billing (or Price Per Job). This change could also appeal to users who are hesitant to share their API keys.

  "ticker": "TSLA",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "openai_api_key": "your_openai_api_key_here"
}
```

### Output Example
```json
{
  "ticker": "TSLA",
  "sentiment": "hold",
  "sentiment_reason": "The sentiment is derived from a mixed outlook among analysts...",
  "report": "# Tesla, Inc. Financial Report - February 11, 2025 ## Executive Summary Tesla, Inc., under the leadership of Elon Musk, continues to be a significant player in the electric vehicle and clean energy sectors..."
